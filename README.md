# ThoughtFlow

A VS Code extension that helps developers understand complex codebases by visualizing code execution paths as explorable mind maps.

## Overview

ThoughtFlow analyzes Python code and generates interactive call graphs, making it easier to trace execution flow and understand how functions interact.

## Project Structure

- `extension/` - VS Code extension (TypeScript)
- `core/` - Core analysis logic (TypeScript)
- `llm-service/` - Optional LLM integration (Python)
- `experiments/` - Prototypes and explorations
- `examples/` - Sample Python codebases for testing
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `scripts/` - Build and setup scripts

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** VS Code, Node.js, Python 3.10+

**Setup:**

1. Clone the repository and open in VS Code
2. Install recommended extensions (VS Code will prompt automatically)
3. Code auto-formats on save - test by messing with the files in `experiments/test-formatting/`

## Course Project

This is a course project for CSCI3100 Software Engineering. AI tools are used in development and properly acknowledged to maintain academic integrity.
