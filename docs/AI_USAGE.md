# AI Tools Usage Acknowledgment

This document acknowledges the use of AI tools in the ThoughtFlow project, in compliance with CSCI3100 academic integrity requirements.

## Purpose

AI tools were used as **development assistants** to accelerate certain aspects of development, allowing the team to focus on design, architecture, and complex problem-solving.

## Tools Used

- **Claude Code** (Anthropic) - Code assistance and boilerplate generation
- **GitHub Copilot** - Code completion (if applicable)
- **ChatGPT/Claude** - Technical discussions and architecture brainstorming (if applicable)

## Scope of AI Usage

### Architecture & Design ‚úÖ **Human-Led**
- Technology stack selection (TypeScript, Python, VS Code APIs)
- System architecture (extension + core + llm-service structure)
- API and interface design
- Feature prioritization and project scope
- Algorithm and logic design

**AI Role**: Discussed trade-offs, suggested patterns, validated technical approaches

### Implementation ü§ñ **AI-Assisted**
- Boilerplate code (project setup, type definitions, basic structures)
- Utility functions and helpers
- Code formatting and structure suggestions
- Error handling patterns

**Human Role**: All code reviewed, understood, tested, and adapted by team members

### Documentation üìù **Collaborative**
- README structure and organization
- API documentation templates
- Code comments and inline documentation

**Human Role**: Content, technical decisions, and project-specific details written by team

## What AI Did NOT Do

- ‚ùå Make architectural decisions
- ‚ùå Design core algorithms or business logic
- ‚ùå Choose project features or scope
- ‚ùå Write code without human review and understanding
- ‚ùå Determine technical approaches or frameworks

## Quality Assurance

All AI-assisted code underwent:
1. **Human review** - Team members read and understood all code
2. **Testing** - Validated functionality and correctness
3. **Adaptation** - Modified to fit project-specific requirements
4. **Integration** - Incorporated into human-designed architecture

## Rationale

Using AI tools reflects modern software development practices. Professional teams use these tools to:
- Reduce time on repetitive tasks
- Focus human effort on complex problem-solving
- Accelerate learning of new technologies

Our use of AI tools follows this professional standard while ensuring the core intellectual work‚Äîdesign, architecture, and critical implementation‚Äîremains human-driven.
